This guide shows you how to create [a simple website](https://matcttu.github.io/) on GitHub pages for free. The website is a fork of the Jekyll theme **[Moon](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon)**. You can browse other free themes at [jekyllthemes.io/free](https://jekyllthemes.io/free).

This guide is not an introduction to Git nor any best practices.

## Getting Started

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

   > Note that the username you choose will be a part of your web address.

   Make sure you verify the confirmation email.

1. Click **Fork** at the top of this page to make a copy of the `matcttu.github.io` repository.

   After a few moments, all of the files will be copied into a repository you own.

1. Click **Settings**.

1. Replace `matcttu` with your username, and then click **Rename**.

   > Note that `**username**.githib.io` will be your site's URL or web address, but before you can visit your site, you need to update the config file.

1. Click `_config.yml` to open the file.

    This config file controls many aspects of the site including front page text, logo and background branding, and social icons, but you can ignore all of that for right now.

1. Click the Pencil icon to open the file for editing and then replace `MATCTTU` on line 11 with your username.

1. Scroll all the way down, then click **Commit changes**.

   > Note that commiting changes directly to the `master` branch and without descriptions is in fact a **BAD** practice. Avoid this in actual colaborative projects.

You can now view your live site at https://username.github.io, replacing `username` with your username, of course.
